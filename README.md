# Veridian Whispers
Veridian Whispers Role-Playing Game developed with Unity


In the Era of the Four Kingdoms, the balance between the physical and spirit worlds has been shattered. A massive disturbance has resurrected four past elemental masters—one from each kingdom—each with their own ambitions and fractured memories.

As spiritual energy ruptures, dark spirits flood the land, wreaking havoc on villages and twisting the elements. Amidst this chaos, you must find your own path.

You will traverse this mythical realm by land and sky with your loyal dragon companion, commanding it to take you to fog-shrouded islands, ancient mountains, and communities in need. Your mission is twofold: to fight the evil spirits that plague the wild, and to build rapport with the villages they terrorize.

The world's hope isn't just in magic, but in connection. Rebuild the frayed bonds of society by partaking in the traditional cafe and tea culture of this fantasy world. In these quiet havens, you'll build trust, uncover quests, and find the strength to face the chaos.

As rival factions vie for control, unsure if the returned masters are saviors or harbingers, will you restore balance from the ground up... or claim power in the age of elemental war?
