Legends of the Four Elements RTS game developed with Unity


In the Era of the Four Kingdoms, the balance between the physical and spirit worlds has been shattered. A massive disturbance in the Spirit World has resurrected four past elemental masters—one from each kingdom—each with their own ambitions and fractured memories. As spiritual energy ruptures, dark spirits flood the land, wreaking havoc on villages and twisting the elements themselves. Now, the kingdoms are in chaos, with rival factions vying for control, unsure whether these returned masters are saviors or harbingers of destruction. Will you restore balance, or claim power in the age of elemental war?
